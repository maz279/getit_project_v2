## 🔧 **REMAINING CRITICAL TASKS**

### HIGH PRIORITY (Next 1-2 hours):
1. **Mount SearchService Microservice** - 1,200+ lines of advanced AI search not connected
2. **Fix DeepSeek AI Service Conflicts** - Multiple implementations causing failures
3. **Enable Real Voice Processing** - Connect to actual speech-to-text services
4. **Complete ML/NLP Integration** - Connect existing services to search pipeline

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (2-4 hours):
1. **Database Enhancement** - Add more products for meaningful search results
2. **Performance Optimization** - Implement caching layer and query optimization
3. **Advanced Analytics** - Enable search analytics and user behavior tracking
4. **Cultural Intelligence** - Bangladesh-specific search enhancements
