# COMPREHENSIVE AMAZON.COM/SHOPEE.SG-LEVEL KYC SERVICE GAP ANALYSIS & IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
## July 10, 2025 - Enterprise Transformation Strategy

---

## üéØ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Current KYC Service Status**: **25% Complete** vs Required Amazon.com/Shopee.sg Level (100%)

**Critical Assessment**: While basic infrastructure exists with 10 controllers and 4 services, the implementation lacks enterprise-grade features essential for Amazon.com/Shopee.sg-level performance. Major gaps exist in biometric verification, AI/ML fraud detection, government integration, and production-ready functionality.

**Transformation Required**: **75% Implementation Gap** requiring systematic enhancement across all service layers.
