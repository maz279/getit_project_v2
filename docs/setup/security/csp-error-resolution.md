# Content Security Policy Error Resolution

## Problem
```
Refused to load the script 'https://replit.com/public/js/replit-dev-banner.js' 
because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: 
"script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'"
```

## Root Cause
The helmet middleware CSP configuration was too restrictive, only allowing scripts from:
- `'self'` (same origin)
- `'unsafe-inline'` (inline scripts)

But the Replit development banner needs to load from `https://replit.com`.

## Solution Applied
Updated CSP directives in `server/routes-minimal.ts`:

### Before:
```javascript
scriptSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
connectSrc: ["'self'", "wss:", "ws:"],
```

### After:
```javascript
scriptSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'", "https://replit.com"],
connectSrc: ["'self'", "wss:", "ws:", "https://replit.com"],
```

## Changes Made
1. Added `https://replit.com` to `scriptSrc` directive to allow Replit scripts
2. Added `https://replit.com` to `connectSrc` directive to allow API connections to Replit

## Expected Result
- Replit dev banner script will load without CSP violations
- Console error will be eliminated
- Development environment will function properly

## Status
âœ… **RESOLVED** - CSP configuration updated to allow Replit development scripts
